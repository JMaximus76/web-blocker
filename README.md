I am making this for a self directed school project and to be honest I don't really know what I'm doing. I've almost never used javascript and I'm still a beginner at coding. If for some reason you find yourself looking at this repositry and my code, I'm sorry. (Also I just lerned how to use git 3 days ago so its kind of scuffed)
