# WORK IN PROGRESS
I am making this for a self directed school project and to be honest I don't really know what I'm doing. If for some reason you find yourself looking at this repository and my code, I'm sorry. (Also I just lerned how to use git 3 days ago so its kind of scuffed)

# Don't look at my Svelte code
When I started working on this project I barely read the documentation for it so I designed terribly. Sorry.
