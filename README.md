# Web Block

Block unwanted websites easily.

In Beta: This extension is under active development and is still missing planned features. Expect that there might be bugs and other issues.

Web Block manages lists of websites that you create. When you navigate to a website on a list it will redirect you to a block page. There are two different types of lists: Block lists which block the websites on them, and Allow lists that allow the websites on them while blocking everything else. Lists can have timers that will keep track of how long you are breaking the rules of the list, once time is up it will go back to blocking the website.
